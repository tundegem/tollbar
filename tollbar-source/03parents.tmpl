		<h3>Leading Parent Partnership Award</h3>
		<p>As you aware the school values the contribution Parents and Carers make to school life
very highly. With this in mind we are aiming to achieve the Leading Parent Partnership
Award (LPPA) in the near future. As always we would like to hear your opinions on
activities and events offered at school as well as ideas for future events (however small or
large).</p>
<p>You already know how much your children enjoy sharing their learning experiences
with you and we hope this enjoyment is shared throughout the school. If you have any
comments or suggestions about how to further development the role of Parents and
Carers in school please feel free to come in. You could have a chat with Miss Whaley
(LPPA co-ordinator) or Mrs Wood (Extended schools co-ordinator) or simply jot your
ideas down and send them in with your child.</p>
<p>We are proud of our Parents and Carers and want their time at Toll Bar Primary to be as
happy for them as it is for their children.</p>

		<h3>RAINBOW Programme</h3>
		<p>We are pleased to announce that we will be starting RAINBOWS again at  the end of September during the school day. We will be having weekly support  groups for our children. We have  successfully run this programme over the last 3 years. </p>
		<p>If your child is part of a single parent family, a step-family, has  experienced the death of a loved one, or is struggling through a painful  experience, this will be an opportunity for him/her to share their thoughts and  help them to deal with them.</p>
		<p>When something significant happens in a family, the entire family is  affected. Even though death, divorce or  other loss issues appear to be only grown-up problems, they have an effect on  the children. Children may find it  extremely difficult to talk about their feelings because of their age and  inexperience.</p>
		<p>We have some very caring trained staff who are willing to help the  children put their feelings into words, building a stronger sense of  self-esteem, and begin to accept what has taken place in the community. All discussions will be treated  confidentially and each person is asked to keep the confidentiality of the  group.</p>
		<p>If you would like your child to take part in the RAINBOW programme, please  make an appointment to see Mrs Clarke. Permission  forms will need to be signed by a parent/carer, and each child will receive  their own letter to explain the RAINBOW programme.</p>
		<p><strong>The support group  will meet every week. </strong></p>
