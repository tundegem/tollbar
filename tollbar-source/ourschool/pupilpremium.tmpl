    <li>Small group support across a wide range of subjects</li>
    <li>Booster groups</li>
    <li>Mentoring</li>
    <li>24/7 revision via mathletics and spellodrome</li>
    <li>Study support</li>
    <li>After-School clubs</li>
    <li>Achievement awards and prizes</li>
    <li>Enrichment activities e.g. Arts weeks</li>
    <li>Small group support for FSM pupils and other vulnerable pupils who are underachieving</li>
</ul>

<p>Each year we will review the impact of the measures listed to ensure they represent both value for
money and played a direct role in improving the achievement of pupils of all abilities.</p>
