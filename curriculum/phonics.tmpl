<h3>Phonics</h3>

<p>At Toll Bar Primary School, early reading is taught using synthetic phonics as the main
approach to reading. Pupils are systematically taught the phonemes (sounds), how to blend
the sounds all through the word for reading, and how to segment the sounds in order to write
words. They are taught to use their phonic skills and knowledge as their first approach to
reading, but are also taught high frequency words which do not completely follow the phonic
rules.</p>

<p>The school follows the government published programme "Letters and Sounds" using a
variety of resources which helps provide a multi-sensory approach to learning phonics.
For more information about phonics, including a video of how to pronounce the phonemes
(sounds), please go to Parents' Information / Parent Guidelines and Information section.
When at home you can find information <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/fun-with-phonics">on the Cbeebies website</a>.</p>

<h3>Reading Schemes</h3>

<p>At Toll Bar Primary School, all our early reading books are colour banded. Your child will
be given a colour band to choose their home reading book from which will help to ensure
that the book they select is at about the right reading level for them. Our core scheme is the
Oxford Reading Tree. The majority of books within the early book bands can be decoded
using phonics skills and knowledge â€“ encourage your child to use their phonics skills to read
at home.</p>

<h3>Reading for Pleasure</h3>

<p>At Toll Bar Primary School, we encourage pupils to develop a love of reading and to borrow
books from our school collection to enjoy with their families. Our staff are very happy
to speak to parents who want to support their child in widening their reading habits. We
have reading for pleasure sessions in every class. Each class has a dedicated reading area
where pupils can read for pleasure. Staff read daily to pupils to increase their pleasure and
enjoyment of reading.</p>
