        <h2>Message from Mrs Northwood</h2>
        <p><strong>Welcome to our School</strong></p>
        <p>In Toll Bar we believe we are a 'Community Primary' school and we intend these pages to reflect some of the things that happen in and around our school with the help of the community that we serve ...... plus all sorts of other interesting bits and pieces!</p>
        <p>We believe Toll Bar Primary School to be a safe, caring environment, where in partnership with you we can try to achieve your child's full potential.</p>
        <p>Our aim in the school is to educate the whole child, and through the curriculum will provide for the learning of skills and knowledge, a child should be given every opportunity to realise their aspirations and express their feelings. The whole curriculum conforms to the requirements of the National Curriculum. We are committed to safeguarding children and promote the welfare of every child in our school. Children respond to the interest and appreciation which we both show in their education, and I hope that our time together will be enjoyable, valued and successful.</p>
