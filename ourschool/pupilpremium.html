<h3>What is Pupil Premium</h3>

<p>In 2011 – 12 the Government launched its Pupil Premium funding. This money is sent to school based on the numbers of pupils in the school who are eligible for Free School Meals (FSM).</p>
<p>From 2012 – 13, it has been expanded to include all children who have been eligible for FSM within the last 6 years.</p>
<p>Nationally, the statistics show that students who are in receipt of FSM do less well than their peers. The aim of this money is to try and close that attainment gap.</p>

<h3>Our Principles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We ensure that teaching and learning opportunities meet the needs of all of our pupils</li>
    <li>We ensure that the needs of our pupils are adequately assessed and addressed and that appropriate provision is made for pupils who belong to vulnerable groups</li>
    <li>We recognise that not all pupils who qualify for FSM will be registered. We therefore reserve the right to allocate the Pupil Premium funding to any pupil or groups of pupils that we can legitimately identify as requiring additional support</li>
    <li>Pupil Premium funding will be allocated following a needs analysis which will identify priority groups or individuals. Limited funding and resources means that not all children receiving FSM will be in receipt of Pupil Premium interventions at one time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provision</h3>
<p>The range of provision the Governors may consider include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reducing class sizes thus improving opportunities for effective Assessment for Learning (AFL) and accelerating progress</li>
    <li>Providing small group work with an experienced member of staff focused on overcoming gaps in learning</li>
    <li>1 to 1 support</li>
    <li>Additional teaching and learning opportunities provided through extra curricular activities</li>
    <li>All our work through Pupil Premium will be aimed at accelerating progress moving children to at least age related expectations. Initially this will be in Literacy and Numeracy</li>
    <li>Pupil Premium resources may also be used to target able children on FSM to achieve L3 at the end of KS1 or L5/6 at the end of KS2</li>
    <li>The Governors will publish information on how they have used their PPG to address the issue of narrowing the gap for socially disadvantaged pupils</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pupil Premium Grant (PPG) Allocation for 2013/14 was &pound;88876</h3>

<p>The Governors targeted the PPG to focus on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pastoral Support – Developing the role of the school Council, improving the Blue Room provision, continued development of the Rainbow programme and extending the Learning Mentor’s role and that of the Parent Support Advisor.</li>
    <li>Improved ICT Provision – Purchase additional laptops and ipads in order to allow our pupils to develop their ICT skills and to use IT as a tool across the curriculum</li>
    <li>Improving Reading results throughout the school using various strategies</li>
    <li>1 to 1 tuition -  employed an experienced teacher to work with individual pupils who requiring specific support to reach their full potential in Numeracy and Literacy</li>
    <li>Purchasing resources and training staff on the ‘First Class Number’ programme to improve pupil attainment in maths</li>
    <li>Employ 2 LSAs to provide additional support in Foundation Stage.</li>
    <li>Effective Feedback – parents of vulnerable children were invited into school to attend meetings with teachers and the Senco to discuss ways to accelerate progress. Teaching cover was required at the time. Regular targets were put into homework diaries so that parents were able to support the progress of their child. Vulnerable groups were given clear steps to move forward on a daily basis through assessment for learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below shows how effective the interventions were to narrow the attainment gap between FSM and non FSM pupils.</p>

<h3>Pupil Premium Grant (PPG) Allocation for 2014/15 is &pound;98100</h3>

<p>This year’s money will be used in a number of different ways in order to improve pupil attainment and to help overcome any barriers to learning: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Pastoral Support – continue to develop the role of the Learning Mentors to support pupils’ self esteem, attitudes to learning, sense of well-being and enjoyment in school. The Parent Support Advisor will continue to develop her work with parents.</li>
    <li>Funding places on school trips – to enhance the curriculum, ensuring the children were able to participate and gain the opportunity to experience new and challenging activities</li>
    <li>Extend Outdoor Learning – providing exciting and different learning experiences outside the classroom is proven to raise attainment, bolster social, emotional and personal development and contributes to the health and wellbeing of children. Outdoor learning stimulates pupils in new ways and provides an insight into life, science, language, literacy and Numeracy, environmental awareness, sustainability and other issues which would not be readily accessible in the classroom/ Use of the Rabbit and Chicken project.</li>
    <li>Purchasing extra resources for use across both Key Stages</li>
    <li>Improving Writing results throughout school using various strategies EG. Talk for Writing.</li>
    <li>Supporting intervention activities for targeted pupils and to provide appropriate training for staff.</li>
    <li>Improving ICT provision - install Clever Touch screens in classrooms to develop ICT skills further and to allow greater use of IT as a tool across the curriculum.</li>
    <li>Implement initiatives to raise attendance so we narrow the gap between FSM attendance and other pupils. The aim is for overall attendance to improve to 92%</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Pupil Premium’ monies have been identified within the school budget by central government in order to target the achievement of
    children identified as being eligible for free school meals, for children who are looked after by the local authority, for example in
    foster care, and for children who have a parent in the armed forces. Whilst these monies may not be targeted to individuals in some cases at school, we have a rigorous system in place for identifying where additional support may be needed. The action plan above details the amount of Pupil Premium and our intentions for these monies and Governors are closely monitoring the impact of these plans.
