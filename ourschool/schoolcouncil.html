		<p>The school council is made up of 2 reps from each class, and they are involved in decisions made in school, such as the Healthy Schools campaign, the canteen, questionnaires for parents and children, and the environmental garden.</p>
        <p>The School Council, recently carried out a survey on reducing traffic speed outside schools to 20mph, in response to a letter from Ed Miliband on the matter.</p>
        <p>The School Council and Mrs Clarke have been working with the LA on developing a Doncaster Charter Mark for Anti-bullying.  At the recent LA launch event for all schools, two of our School Council members stood up and presented the Charter Mark to approximately 100 people.  We are very proud of them.</p>
