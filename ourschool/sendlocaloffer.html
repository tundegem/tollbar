        <h3>What is the SEND Local Offer?</h3>
        <p>ï»¿The government has listened to what parents say their experience of services is like and have put in place a number of things to bring about improvements. One of these is the 'Local Offer'.  In 2012 the former Children's Minister Sarah Teather explained that:</p>
        <p>"The current system is outdated and not fit for purpose. Thousands of families have had to battle for months, even years, with different agencies to get the specialist care their children need. It is unacceptable they are forced to go from pillar to post, facing agonising delays and bureaucracy to get support, therapy and equipment".</p>
        <p>"It is a huge step forward to require health, education and care services work together. The reforms will give parents better information and a comprehensive package of support that meets their needs".</p>
        <p>Local authorities and other services will set out a local offer of all services available to support children who are disabled or who have SEN and their families. The local offer will enable families to understand what services they can access and what support they can expect from a range of local agencies, including from the local authority, health services, schools, leisure services and the voluntary sector. The offer will include provision from birth to 25, across education, health and social care.</p>
        <p>The potential outcomes of the Local Offer are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide clarity and confidence for parents.</li>
            <li>To support earlier intervention.</li>
            <li>To reduce the need for assessment.</li>
            <li>To identify need and gaps in provision.</li>
            <li>To provide an evidence base for improving progress and securing better outcomes, at school and local level.</li>
        </ul>

<p><em>What are the different types of support available for children with SEN inToll Bar?</em></p>


<p><strong>Class teacher input via excellent targeted classroom teaching also known as Quality First Teaching</strong></p>

<p>For your child this would mean:</p>

<ul>
    <li>That the teacher had the highest possible expectations for your child and all pupils in their class.</li>
    <li>That all teaching is based on building on what your child already knows, can do and can understand.</li>
    <li>At times the teacher may direct the class based Teaching Assistant to work with your child as part of normal working practice.</li>
    <li>Different ways of teaching are in place so that your child is fully involved in learning in class. This may involve things like using more practical learning.</li>
    <li>Specific strategies (which may be suggested by the SENCO or outside staff) are in place to support your child to learn.</li>
    <li>Your child&rsquo;s teacher will have carefully checked on your child&rsquo;s progress and will have decided that your child has gaps in their understanding/learning and needs some extra support to help them make the best possible progress.</li>
    <li>All children in school should be getting this as part of excellent classroom, practice when needed.</li>
    <li>Specific group work with in a smaller group of children.</li>
</ul>

<p>This group, often called intervention groups by schools, may be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Run in the classroom or outside.</li>
    <li>Run by a teacher or most often a Teaching Assistant who has had training to run these groups.</li>
    <li>Stage of SEN Code of Practice: School Action</li>
</ul>

<p>This means they have been identified by the class teacher as needing some extra support in school.</p>

<p>For your child this would mean:</p>

<ul>
    <li>He/she will engage in group sessions with specific targets to help him/her to make progress.</li>
    <li>A learning Support Assistant/teacher or outside professional (;like a Speech and Language Therapist) will run these small group sessions using the teacher&rsquo;s plan.</li>
    <li>This type of support is available for any child who has specific gaps in their understanding of a subject/area of learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specialist groups run by outside agencies e.g. Speech and Language therapy or Occupational therapy groups</p>

<p><strong>Stage of SEN Code of Practice: School Action Plus</strong></p>

<p>This means they have been identified by the SENCO as needing some extra specialist support in school from a professional outside the school. This may be from:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Local Authority central services such as ASD Outreach or Sensory Service (for pupils with a hearing or visual need).</li>
    <li>Outside agencies such as the Speech and Language therapy (SALT) Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>For your child this would mean:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your child will have been identified by the class teacher or SENCO (or you will have raised your own concerns) as needing more specialist input instead of or in addition to quality first teaching and intervention groups.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to come to a meeting to discuss your child&rsquo;s progress and help plan possible ways forward.</li>
    <li>You may be asked to give your permission for the school to refer your child to a specialist professional e.g. a Speech and Language Therapist or Educational Psychologist This will help the school and yourself understand your child&rsquo;s particular needs betters and be able to support them better in school.</li>
</ul>

<p>The specialist professional will work with your child to understand their needs and make recommendations, which may include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Making changes to the way your child is supported in class e.g. some individual support or changing some aspects of teaching to support them better.</li>
    <li>Support to set better targets which will include their specific expertise.</li>
    <li>A group run by our Learning Mentors under the guidance of the outside professional e.g. a social skills group.</li>
    <li>A group or individual work with outside professional.</li>
</ul>

<p>The school may suggest that your child needs some individual support in school.  They will tell you how the support will be used and what strategies will be put in place.  This type of support is available for children with specific barriers to learning that cannot be overcome through Quality First Teaching and intervention groups.</p>


<p><strong>Specified Individual support</strong></p>

<p>This is usually provided via a Statement of Special Educational Needs or an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). This means your child will have been identified by the class teacher or SENCO as needing a particularly high level of support or small group teaching (the amount of hours will be specified by a Statement of Special Educational Needs), which cannot be provided from the budget available to the school.</p>

<p>Usually your child will also need support from professional outside the school. This may be from:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Local Authority central services such as the ASD Outreach Team or Sensory Service (for students with a hearing or visual need).</li>
    <li>Outside agencies such as the Speech and Language therapy (SALT) Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>For your child this would mean:</p>

<p>The school (or you) can request that the Local Authority carry out a statutory assessment of your child&rsquo;s needs. This is a legal process which sets out the amount of support that will be provided for your child.</p>

<p>After the school have sent in the request to the Local Authority (with a lot of information about your child, including some from you), they will decide whether they think your child&rsquo;s needs (as described in the paperwork provided), seem complex enough to need a statutory assessment. If this is the case they will ask you and all the professionals involved with your child to write a report outlining your child&rsquo;s needs. If they do not think your child needs this , they will ask the school to continue with the support at School Action Plus</p>

<p>After the reports have all been sent to the Local Authority (L.A). The L.A will then decide if your child&rsquo;s needs are severe, complex and lifelong and that they need more specified extra support in school to make good progress. If this is the case they will write a Statement of Special Educational Needs or Education health Care Plan (EHCP). If this is not the case they will ask the school to continue with the support at School Action Plus and also set up a meeting in school to ensure a plan is in place to ensure your child makes as much progress as possible.</p>

<p>The Statement or ECHP will outline the number of hours of individual/small group support your child will receive from the LA and how the support should be used and what strategies must be put in place. It will also have long and short term goals for your child. The additional adult may be used to support your child with whole class learning, run individual programmers or run small groups including your child.</p>

<p>This type of support is available for children whose learning needs are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe, complex and lifelong</li>
    <li>Need more than a specified number of hours support in school</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I let the school know I am concerned about my child&rsquo;s progress in school?</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you have concerns about your child&rsquo;s progress you should speak to your child&rsquo;s class teacher initially.</li>
    <li>If you are not happy that the concerns are being managed and that your child is still not making progress you should speak to the SENCO/ Inclusion Manager or Head Teacher.</li>
    <li>If you are still not happy you can speak to the school SEND Governor.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How will the school let me know if they have concerns about my child&rsquo;s learning in school?</em></p>

<p>If your child is then identified as not making progress the school will set up a meeting to discuss this with you in more detail and to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Listen to any concerns you may have.</li>
    <li>Plan any additional support your child may receive.</li>
</ul>
