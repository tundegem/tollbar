    <p>School dinners cost <strong>&pound;2</strong> per day (&pound;10 per week),
    for a healthy, locally sourced meal. If paying by cheque, please make cheques payable to DMBC.</p>

    <h3>Free School Meals for Reception, Year 1 and Year 2</h3>
    <p>From this September, every child in reception, year 1 and year 2 will be offered a free school meal.  This could save you up to £380 a year for each child you have in Key Stage 1.</p>
    <p>All Key Stage 1 pupils in Doncaster schools will be welcome to stay to lunch and enjoy an award winning, nutritious, hot meal with their friends at lunch time from September.</p>
    <p>The change is part of a new Government initiative which aims to ensure that all children can benefit from a hot meal at lunchtime.</p>
    <p>Studies show that the benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a healthy diet</li>
        <li>improved concentration in the afternoons</li>
        <li>better behaviour and atmosphere in school as a result of all pupils (and an increasing numbers of teachers) eating together every day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Schools Catering already provide Food for Life Bronze award winning menus to over 58% of primary school children in Doncaster. This is the highest percentage take up in the area and compares very favourably to the national average of 43%.</p>
    <p>View sample menus and other details about school meals online at: <a href="http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/schoolmeals">www.doncaster.gov.uk/schoolmeals</a></p>
    <p>If your child has a medical need for a special diet, please contact the school for further details on how this can be supported.</p>
    <p>We are asking all parents and guardians that have a statutory right to free school meals, because they are in receipt of one of the benefits listed below, to complete an application form on-line at www.doncaster.gov.uk before their child starts school.</p>
    <p>This is because funding is granted to schools, based on the number of their pupils who are entitled to receive these free meals. For every pupil entitled to claim free school meals as a benefit, the school receives £1,300. This additional funding is called Pupil Premium. This money is used in a variety of creative and innovative ways to help support individual pupils and the whole school community. The allocation of this funding is at the school’s discretion but it is used to help identified pupils to maintain academic progression and attainment.</p>
    <p>The school receives extra money for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>children eligible for free school meals currently or during the past six years</li>
            <li>children with parents currently serving in the armed forces</li>
            <li>children in care and adopted children</li>
        </ul>
    <p>It is really important that if your child has been eligible for free school meals (however briefly) during the last six years, then you should claim.</p>
    <p>Children may be eligible if their parents/carers are receiving.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Income Support</li>
        <li>Income-based Jobseekers Allowance</li>
        <li>Income-related Employment Support Allowance</li>
        <li>Child Tax Credit but not Working Tax Credit and your annual income is below £16,190 (as worked out by HM Revenues and Customs)</li>
        <li>Pension Credit Guarantee</li>
        <li>Support under part 6 of the Asylum Seekers Act</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is also important that if you have an older child in school (key stage 2 and above) that you continue to apply for free school meal benefit if you qualify.</p>
    <p>Even if you don’t want your child to receive a free meal, we would encourage you to register for free school meals so that their school receives as much funding as possible. You may be entitled to other benefits for your child, for example, free school milk for children under seven, or help towards board and lodging charges for school trips.</p>
    <p>For more information on how your school allocates Pupil Premium funding, please see the <a href="/ourschool/pupilpremium.html">our pupil premium page</a>. Alternatively, for more guidance on the Pupil Premium, visit <a href="http://www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a></p>

    <h3>Packed Lunches</h3>
    <p>For pupils who have packed lunches, they can eat in the community room.</p>
    <p>Everyday, our professionally qualified catering teams provide around 20,000 meals in 122 schools throughout Doncaster. Our meals offer an exciting choice of healthy, fresh food at excellent value.

    <p>We believe that school meals represent the best option in terms of
    contributing to a healthy diet and value for money, when compared to other
    sources of food available to children for their mid day meal, i.e. packed lunches.</p>

    <p>All our menus comply with current food and nutritional standards. </p>

    <p>We don't use additives which are harmful, mechanically recovered meat,
    or genetically modified ingredients.  </p>

    <p>We do serve fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh bread and healthy drinks
    such as pure fruit juices, milk drinks and smoothies, along with the
    guaranteed inclusion of fish which is rich in Omega 3.</p>
    
    <p>If you feel that your child may be entitled to free school meals, please contact the council on 01302 734123
    and more information is available <a href="http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/sections/educationandlearning/pupilandparentinformation/schoolmeals/Free_School_Meals.aspx">

    <h3>School Meals aren't horsing around!</h3>

    <p>With all that’s currently going on about horse meat being found in burgers we are pleased to announce that school meals in Doncaster are as safe and well sourced as ever.</p>

    <p>Doncaster's School Meals service doesn't currently serve burgers, but if we did, the beef would be traceable and most likely from Yorkshire as is the case with much of our current supplies. For example, we currently use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Doncaster pork</li>
        <li>Sausages made to our own specification from Doncaster pork</li>
        <li>British chicken</li>
        <li>Yorkshire beef</li>
        <li>Yorkshire free range eggs</li>
        <li>Yorkshire fresh milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>School meals:  Healthy, tasty and affordable… and horse free!</p>
