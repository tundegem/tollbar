    <p>School dinners cost <strong>&pound;2</strong> per day (&pound;10 per week),
    for a healthy, locally sourced meal. If paying by cheque, please make cheques payable to DMBC.</p>
    <h3>Packed Lunches</h3>
    <p>For pupils who have packed lunches, they can eat in the community room.</p>
    <p>Everyday, our professionally qualified catering teams provide around 20,000 meals in 122 schools throughout Doncaster. Our meals offer an exciting choice of healthy, fresh food at excellent value.

    <p>We believe that school meals represent the best option in terms of
    contributing to a healthy diet and value for money, when compared to other
    sources of food available to children for their mid day meal, i.e. packed lunches.</p>

    <p>All our menus comply with current food and nutritional standards. </p>

    <p>We don't use additives which are harmful, mechanically recovered meat,
    or genetically modified ingredients.  </p>

    <p>We do serve fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh bread and healthy drinks
    such as pure fruit juices, milk drinks and smoothies, along with the
    guaranteed inclusion of fish which is rich in Omega 3.</p>
    
    <p>If you feel that your child may be entitled to free school meals, please contact the council on 01302 734123
    and more information is available <a href="http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/sections/educationandlearning/pupilandparentinformation/schoolmeals/Free_School_Meals.aspx">

    <h3>School Meals aren't horsing around!</h3>

    <p>With all that’s currently going on about horse meat being found in burgers we are pleased to announce that school meals in Doncaster are as safe and well sourced as ever.</p>

    <p>Doncaster's School Meals service doesn't currently serve burgers, but if we did, the beef would be traceable and most likely from Yorkshire as is the case with much of our current supplies. For example, we currently use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Doncaster pork</li>
        <li>Sausages made to our own specification from Doncaster pork</li>
        <li>British chicken</li>
        <li>Yorkshire beef</li>
        <li>Yorkshire free range eggs</li>
        <li>Yorkshire fresh milk</li>
    </ul>
School meals:  Healthy, tasty and affordable… and horse free!
