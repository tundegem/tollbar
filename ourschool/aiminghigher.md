We first visited Toll Bar primary on 22nd October 2012. It was a dreary Monday morning, but the group were very energised yet well behaved! They sat and listened to an introduction to who we were, where we were from and also why we were visiting them at school that day. The Yr 5 / 6 group received us well, and were already asking some very valid and well thought out questions, even minutes into the day.

We moved into the sports hall, where they partook in an aspiration raising activity called ‘stepping stones’. The activity involved the pupils lining up along the back wall and stepping onto 8 pieces of paper laid out in front of them, with each ‘stone’ prompting them to answer a question relating to their future and how they hope to get there. The questions read as follows:

* What is my dream job?
* How would I feel if this was my job?
* What do I need to be able to get this job?
* Who will I need to help me?
* What can I do to help myself?
* What could stop me from getting my dream job?
*Will I let them stop me, or keep trying?
*What would having this job mean to me?

The activity took a while to get set up, but they kept their focus really well and most of them became totally involved in the activity, thinking about their futures realistically and seriously. We went through the questions individually and allowed some time for discussion between each one. The student ambassadors, student teachers and teaching staff all supported this activity which was really nice to see. The answers that were offered include:

The language used and ideas expressed were very advanced and profound for this age group, compared to the answers previously received from some older peers. It is a very honest account of issues affecting young people today; this exercise really demonstrates their perceptions of their environment and lifestyle.

We then did an activity in small groups on what a student looks like. Each group were given a large piece of paper and were tasked with drawing a ‘typical student’. The outcome of this was quite interesting, as most of the group drew male students, who they labelled as ‘geeks’ or ‘rich’. Others drew females with long flowing hair and long glamorous eyelashes (no doubt what they have seen as a student on Hollyoaks!). One group drew their student in traditional cap and gown attire. A discussion followed as to what a student looks like and they all then agreed that students came in all different shapes and sizes, and most importantly from all different backgrounds.

The final activity to take place in the hall was a quick game of true or false, where the pupils had to move to the right hand side of the hall if they believed a statement to be true, the left if they believed it be false and stay in the middle if they really were not sure. They were asked things such as ‘You have to be 18 to go to university’, ‘you do not have to wear a uniform at university’ and ‘students do not get showers!’. This was a fun interactive way to see how much they had picked up on throughout the morning so far, which was quite a lot, they had obviously been paying attention!

Once back in the classroom, we recapped on what we had done that morning in order for them to complete the evaluation forms. The two student ambassadors were then ‘grilled’ by the group, who like earlier in the morning, asked some very good quality questions about university and student life. The questions just kept on coming!

By looking at the evaluations from the first visit, they had learnt that:

* You do not have to be rich to go to university.
* You can join lots of different clubs, like sports!
* You do not have to go to university.
* University is interesting
* You can have your own room at university
* You can get money from the government
* You do not have to wear a uniform
* Students do not all look the same.

They identified the stepping stones and drawing activity as their favourite part of the day, as well as getting to see the student ambassadors.

Even as we were walking out of the classroom they continued to ask questions! We had hoped that they would be engaged but did not realise they would be so interested! A really good first visit which certainly made us look forward to seeing them onsite at York St John the following month.

Upon greeting the students in Holgate reception on the morning our first graduation ceremony of 2012 was also taking place, seeing their excited and intrigued faces at the sight of seeing the graduands strutting around in their robes told us that the group were certainly going to get a lot out of their onsite visit to YSJ.

We began the day by reminding them of what they had done three weeks previously and also what they had told us from the activities they had got so eagerly involved in. The group appeared to not need much reminding as they were very vocal in recalling the events and also what they had learnt, which was very encouraging!

The group was split into four smaller groups and allocated a student ambassador, who they would remain with for the rest of the day. An introductory question & answer session took place before the groups began their campus orienteering activity. This allowed for the groups to have a tour of the beautiful and lively campus whilst following cryptic clues about students and university life! Some of the parents and other elders remained in the room to hear about student finance, university in general and to have any myths dispelled and concerns pacified. This was particularly useful for one parent in particular, who also had a sixteen year old son who was thinking about university in order to become an engineer but was very worried about the financial implications.

Once they returned from their campus adventure, they played course Pictionary in their groups. This was slightly competitive as each group had ten minutes to get as many correct drawings as possible, with each drawing being a course that could be studied at UK universities. This activity was to demonstrate the wide range of courses available, some weird and wonderful! The last activity before lunch was an interactive power point presentation titled ‘Inspire a Generation’ highlighting the achievements of some of Britain’s Olympic heroes of 2012, but also with the message of working hard to achieve your dreams and not letting critics, injury, disability and other factors get in your way.

After lunch, the parent / guardians went on their campus tour and left the groups to prepare collages on ‘what is a university?’ to present upon their return. Each group used old prospectuses to find images and supporting information, but every group also drew pictures and wrote words of their own, with one very creative girl even fashioning a mortar board out of paper and elastic bands! The presentations were all very well prepared and thought out, with each group demonstrating the knowledge they had acquired over the two sessions spent with us. The common theme throughout all presentations was that:

* Universities are fun
* You make lots of new friends at universities
* You have to work hard at university
* They are nice places to be and learn
* You graduate at university if you work hard
* Coming to university can help you to get a job when you are older

The day ended with our very own ‘mini graduation’ where each individual student was presented with a personalised certificate rolled up and tied with red ribbon like a traditional degree certificate upon shaking the hand of a university official. This part they really enjoyed, with some cheekily remarking to the student ambassadors that they had graduated before them!

Final evaluations were carried out, the most popular activities of the day being the campus orienteering and collage making, with many adding that they just were happy to meet the students and see them in their outfits. Others commented on the library and how much they enjoyed visiting that, along with those who preferred the ‘Hogwarts bit’ (referring to the old Quad building that does resemble something out of Harry Potter!). Interestingly, 21 responded that they think they might like to go to university now when they are older, with just two saying no and one who still is not sure.

Regardless of if these young people do eventually decide that university is the right option for them in the future, it is apparent that the visits have definitely raised aspirations, understanding and awareness of Higher Education and also opened their eyes to the possibilities and opportunities that are just as accessible to them as everyone else. This too, could be said also for some of the parents who expressed an interest in entering Higher Education themselves.
