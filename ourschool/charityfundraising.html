<h3>Kilimanjaro</h3>

    <p>Alex Price, a second year university student from Leeds Metropolitan University, came into school on Thursday 20th June 2013  and told us all about her climb up Kilimanjaro in Africa, to raise money for less privileged children in Africa and how the charity we are supporting will be building schools for children.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="/ourschool/childreach.png" alt="Childreach International"/></div>
        <p>Childreach International works with children in Nepal, Cambodia, Tanzania and India to ensure they have a good
            education, a good health and rights and protection. The money raised will be going towards building primary schools in Tanzania. You can find more information <a href="http://www.childreach.org.uk/our-work/tanzania-2012">on their website</a>.</p>
    <p>Alex told us:</p>
    <p><em>On the 19th August 2013, I will be climbing to the summit of the highest free-standing mountain in the world:
        Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, East Africa. I will be climbing for the charity Childreach International.
        This charity aims to give children the most out of life including a good education, good health services and
        rights and protection. They work across the world in places such as Tanzania, Nepal, Cambodia and India.</em></p>
    <p><em>The money raised for my climb will go towards building schools in Tanzania for less privileged children.
        They will provide the pupils with better bathrooms, kitchens and classroom equipment.</em></p>
    <p><em>The climb will take approximately 7 days as I trek 19,336ft to the top. I will have to acclimatise to the lower oxygen levels and temperatures which can drop to around -20 degrees at the summit.</em></p>
    <p><em>Every penny really does count for this charity so thank you so much for your support and any donations received.</em></p>
