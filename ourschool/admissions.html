    <p>For information about admission into Toll Bar Primary School, please see
    <a href="/ourschool/policies/admissions.pdf">our admissions policy</a> and
    <a href="http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/sections/educationandlearning/pupilandparentinformation/admissions/index.aspx">Doncaster Council's school admissions page</a>.</p>

    <p>Toll Bar Primary School is a community school for 3-11 year olds.  There is a Nursery in the Foundation unit.  Children receive full time education from the beginning of the school year in which they are 5 until they are 11 when they transfer to secondary school.  We currently have 160 children on roll.</p>
    <p>Children are admitted to the Lower foundation unit on a part time basis in the September following their 3rd birthday, if you would like a place for your child you should complete the form sent to your home address by DMBC. These forms are sent out in August about 13 months before your child would start in the September. Please return to the school or DMBC before the closing date in October.</p>
    <p>Foundation Stage Staff like to visit the children in their own homes prior to them starting school. The purpose of the home visit is to explain what happens in the Foundation unit, to give parents the opportunity to ask questions and in general terms help us get to know one another better. We aim to establish firm partnership foundations between teachers and parents from the outset so that ideas and expertise can be shared for the well-being and development of all children.</p>
    <p>You will also be invited to visit the Foundation unit with your child.   This will help him/her to become familiar with school and the adults who work here.   We hope your child will enjoy the visit, you will be  expected to stay with your child on this visit.</p>
    <p>Please bring your child on the start date you are given.   We try to settle in a few new children each day.   We encourage you to stay with your child for a short time to help settle them in.</p>
    <p>Most children usually settle down and join in activities.  The staff will contact you any problem persists.</p>
    <p>Children transfer to the Upper Foundation Stage in the September following their fourth birthday. The relevant admissions forms will be given to parents in the September for the following September.</p>
    <p>There may be some early places available in the Lower Foundation class for children who will be 3 between 1st September and 31 December; they will be invited to start at the beginning of January, and children who will be 3 between 1st January and 31st March will be invited to start after the Easter Holidays.</p>
    <p>Parents are notified if there are any early places are available.  Taking up an early place is not statutory and refusal to do so does not affect September places.</p>
    <p>Parents considering sending their children to the school are welcome to telephone and make arrangements to visit at their convenience.</p>
    <p>Parents arriving in the catchment area with older children, or who are considering sending their children to the school for any other reason, are invited to contact the school to arrange a visit and discuss the admission with the Headteacher.  Children in any year group can be admitted after consultation with the Education Office, if numbers allow.</p>
    <p>The Board of Governors has agreed to adopt the current LA admissions policy.</p>
