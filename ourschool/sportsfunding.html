<p>The government is providing funding of &pound;150 million per annum for the academic years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015
    to provide new and substantial primary school sport funding. The funding is being jointly provided by the Departments
    for Education, Health and Culture, Media and Sport, and will see money going directly to primary school Head Teachers
    to spend on improving the quality of sport and PE for all their children. Each school will receive &pound;8,000 plus an extra
    &pound;5 per pupil each year for the next two years, at Toll Bar Primary School that will mean around &pound;8,600 per academic year.
    This money can only be spent on sport and PE provision in schools.</p>

<p>At Toll Bar Primary School the governors agree that the money must be used so that all children benefit regardless of
    their sporting ability. We will use our Sports Funding Allocation to continue to place a very high priority on our PE provision.</p>
