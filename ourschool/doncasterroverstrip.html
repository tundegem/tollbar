<p>Four lucky pupils were invited to watch Doncaster Rovers' match on Saturday 19th January and, as a special treat, they got chance to take part in the 'pre-match shirt shaking' and a VIP tour around the stadium.  They got to look around the changing rooms, sit in the team dugout and run down the team tunnel onto the pitch.</p>
