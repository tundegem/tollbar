<p>We have managed to arrange this Holiday Club because we have received funding from the BBC Children in Need.
    This has enabled us to offer this free of charge to children in Oak, Cedar, Willow and Chestnut Classes only.</p>
<p> All coaches are qualified sports Coaches and have been CRB checked.</p>
<p> When you come to the Holiday Club please note the following: -</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access will be through the new door to the Community Room. (The front door will be locked)</li>
    <li>Please see MISS MASON or MR JONES first to let them know you are here. They will be in the Community Room.</li>
    <li>To take part in the sporting activities you will need to bring your trainers and kit</li>
    <li>A packed lunch will be provided for every child, each day.</li>
    <li>You will not be allowed to leave the premises to go to the shop or home during the sessions or at lunch breaks.</li>
    <li>You will not need to bring any money</li>
    <li>All children MUST be signed out by an adult</li>
    <li>If there is any unacceptable behaviour, parents will be contacted to collect you immediately</li>
</ul>
