		<p>The new 'Rotary Garden' at Toll Bar Primary School was opened by the co-presenter of <em>Look North</em>, Christa Ackroyd, at 12 noon on Wednesday, 20th May 2009.</p>
		<p>Following the disastrous floods of Summer 2007, the Rotary Club of Doncaster St Leger secured &pound;25,000 from the Rotary Flood Disaster Relief Fund to replace the ruined 'green greenhouse' and allotment areas at Toll Bar School with an 'environmental garden'. The scheme was designed to raise the spirits and lift the imagination of the children in the aftermath of the disaster. Whole school consultation took place and the original garden was extended to include a wetland area, performance circle and other discrete spaces to develop the excitement of growing. Work on the site was delayed until the school was moved back from temporary buildings into the refurbished school but commenced in the Autumn of 2008 and is now complete. Final design and construction was undertaken by Axholme Landscapes with input from the School and the Rotary Club.</p>
