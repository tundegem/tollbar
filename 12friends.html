    <h3>Message from Friends of Toll Bar Primary School</h3>

    <p>Thank you for your support, we are always looking for new members, ideas for
    fundraising etc.  Over the past 12 months we have purchased Kindles for the
    children to use during wet playtimes, celebration mugs for the Royal Wedding,
    the party for the Diamond Jubilee celebration and we are looking to buy some more playground
    equipment so that all the children benefit from your fundraising efforts.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you once again.</p>
